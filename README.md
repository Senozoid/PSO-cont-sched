# PSO for Container Scheduling (INCOMPLETE)

**TRYING TO FIX A BUG OVER AT [A DIFFERENT BRANCH](https://github.com/Senozoid/PSO-cont-sched/tree/bugfinder), CURRENTLY THE CODE WON'T WORK**

This program attempts to demonstrate how Particle Swarm Optimization might be implemented for container scheduling. \
It's incomplete, and currently looks like [this](https://youtu.be/MwZ1RjkcAKc). \
There are bugs, check [issues](https://github.com/Senozoid/PSO-cont-sched/issues).

## How to run this program

1. Install JRE, if you don't have it installed
2. Open terminal in `src` folder
3. If you are doing this the first time, run `javac *`, otherwise skip this step
