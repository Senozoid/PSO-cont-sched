# PSO for Container Scheduling

This program attempts to demonstrate how Particle Swarm Optimization might be implemented for container scheduling. \
It is almost complete, and currently looks like [this](https://youtu.be/KRO44ZWNkkk).

## How to run this program

1. Install JRE, if you don't have it installed
2. Open terminal in `src` folder
3. If you are doing this the first time, run `javac *`, otherwise skip this step
4. Run `java Optimizer`

## How this program works

Particle Swarm Optimization needs 4 things:

1. The search space
2. The swarm of particles
3. Parameters to tell the swarm how to search
4. A fitness function to tell the swarm what to search for

In this program takes all of these from the user input. \
However, a fitness "mapping" is automatically generated by the program, which the user can choose to keep or overwrite. \
Since we do not actually have a cloud implementation, procedural generation and user input are what this currently works on.

## Future plans

1. Implement GUI
2. Use something like CloudSim
